Remember,
<%= %> - anything will be read as raw text
<%- %> - will be read as HTML
<%  %> - will be read as javascript


with ejs we can serve static files through app.use(express.static("public")); a bit of middleware that grabs the content of a folder, in this case the "public" folder. Of course in such a case only folders that should be accessible to everyone should be in there.
