       so we can reuse given basic things like headers etc. note the %- this means that the stuff inside the tag 
      will be parsed as HTML, as opposed to %= which will parse it as raw text. If the content in the partial file is dynamic,
       you can add a second {} which will contain properties just like in app.js -->
